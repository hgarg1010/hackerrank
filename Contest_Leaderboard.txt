Question:

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.
